To set up arduino for the ESP32, follow these instructions

https://microcontrollerslab.com/install-esp32-arduino-ide/

or any other similar resource. This will allow you to select the correct board, which is

In addition, the ServoESP32 library should also be installed via the library manager.

The code should compile after this.
